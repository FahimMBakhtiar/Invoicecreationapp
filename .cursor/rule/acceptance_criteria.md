> Version: Frontend Only (No backend integration yet)

---

## 1. General UI & User Experience
- [ ] The app loads without errors in a supported browser.
- [ ] Page layout is visually clear, organized, and aligns with the provided design system (see Figma reference).
- [ ] Branding, logo, and color themes match the mockup or brand guidelines.
- [ ] All buttons, forms, and inputs are keyboard accessible.
- [ ] App is responsive and displays correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- [ ] Visual feedback is provided for all actionable elements (hover, active, disabled states).
- [ ] No critical accessibility blockers for users with basic assistive technologies.
- [ ] Text, icons, and controls remain visible and legible under light and dark backgrounds (if applicable).

## 2. Invoice List & Navigation
- [ ] The "Saved Invoices" panel displays all locally-saved invoices, ordered in a user-friendly fashion.
- [ ] Each invoice in the list displays number, customer name, and date as in the design.
- [ ] Selecting a saved invoice loads its full details in the right panel.
- [ ] The "New Invoice" button clears the current selection and displays the invoice creation form.
- [ ] Deleting an invoice removes it from the list and the underlying storage.
- [ ] When there are no invoices, an empty state message is shown.

## 3. Invoice Creation & Editing
- [ ] Clicking "New Invoice" shows a blank invoice form with autogenerated invoice number and today’s date.
- [ ] Invoice form has fields for: business, customer, line items, notes, tax, discount, and advance paid.
- [ ] User can add one or more line items; each requires item, quantity, cost, size, and optional description.
- [ ] User can remove any line item unless only one remains.
- [ ] Invoice number field is visible but not directly editable (disabled for editing).
- [ ] Invoice “Save” validates all required fields and will not save if validation fails.
- [ ] On save, data is persisted to browser local storage and visually updated.
- [ ] "Cancel" reverts to previous state without persisting changes.

## 4. Invoice Viewing & Preview
- [ ] Selecting an invoice displays a read-only preview matching form data and design (including brand/Instagram links, line item table, totals, notes, etc).
- [ ] Preview includes subtotal, tax, discount, total, advance, and due amount fields (all calculations must be correct and match the formula).
- [ ] Notes section is only visible if notes are present.
- [ ] All displayed dates use a clear, user-friendly date format.

## 5. Print and Download (Stub Functionality for Frontend)
- [ ] “Print” opens the browser print dialog with the invoice preview styled for print.
- [ ] “Download” triggers an alert or message indicating PDF download is stubbed/not yet functional.
- [ ] Print view hides navigation and controls as intended by design.

## 6. Data Persistence (Frontend Only)
- [ ] Created and edited invoices are saved to browser localStorage.
- [ ] LocalStorage is updated immediately after save/delete actions.
- [ ] Reloading or closing and reopening the browser preserves invoices.
- [ ] No backend or network requests are performed by the app in this version.

## 7. Input Validation, Feedback, and Error Handling
- [ ] All required form inputs must be filled before saving, with disabled/inactive state until valid.
- [ ] Fields for email must validate as valid email types; numbers must not accept negative values where not permitted.
- [ ] User feedback is shown if validation fails (for instance, required fields, invalid format, or attempt to delete the last line item).

## 8. Out of Scope for Current Version
- [ ] No API integration or server storage.
- [ ] No user authentication or access control flows.
- [ ] No multi-user collaboration.
- [ ] No advanced accessibility or WCAG conformance testing beyond stated above.
